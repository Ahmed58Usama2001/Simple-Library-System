### Simple-Library-System

This project is an educational project so it is cosidered as mini project. It was made as a part of udemy course (mastering 4 critical skills using C++). This console project was made as a solid application on structs and the other programming fundamentals using only C++.
Our system is used only by the admin of the library. It has many features as you can of course add books and users, you can also search these books using a prefix, print the names of users who borrowed a specefied book , list all the books in the library ordered alphabetically or ordered by their ids.
If some user borrowed a book or returned a book that can be informed to our system putting in cosideration the number of available copies.
And of course we can list the names of users and ids of books they have borrowed and didn`t return yet.
